# Overview

Marketing teams running B2B paid media at scale face a recurring problem: **accounts end up in multiple campaigns at once** (persona, category awareness, solution-led, pursuit), which dilutes messaging, causes audience fatigue, and forces manual list work—uploads, exclusions, and suppression—across LinkedIn Account Match (Account Destination). Without **waterfall prioritization** and **automated campaign assignment**, there is no single place to decide which account gets which message, and operations do not scale.

The **Paid Media Controller** addresses this problem using **Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition (AJO B2B)** and **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)** together. One **account journey** reads a qualified-account audience from Real-Time CDP, applies **split-path (waterfall) logic** to assign each account to exactly one campaign tier, and **activates each path directly** to paid media destinations (e.g., LinkedIn Matched Audiences)—with no manual list handoffs.  

The outcome is precision control, less overlap, and a repeatable pattern for multichannel B2B paid media orchestration.

# Use Case: A Marketer’s Story — Why a Controller Matters

*Maya leads paid media for a global B2B brand. Her team runs dozens of campaigns—foundational awareness, category intent (Journey, Data, Content), solution-led programs, persona campaigns, and must-win pursuits. She has a problem.*

## The Problem

The same accounts show up in multiple campaigns. A high-intent Journey account is also in a broad awareness list; a pursuit account still gets persona ads.  

List uploads and exclusions are manual. Every time sales updates a “must-win” list or a new persona campaign launches, her team re-exports audiences, reconciles overlaps in spreadsheets, and re-uploads to LinkedIn and other platforms.

It’s slow, error-prone, and doesn’t scale.

## What She Wants

One place where every qualified account is evaluated once, assigned to the *most relevant* campaign using clear priority rules (waterfall), and sent to the right paid media destination—automatically.

No manual list handoffs.

When data or strategy changes, the system re-evaluates and moves accounts between campaigns without manual intervention.

## Adobe’s Answer

With **AJO B2B and AEP working together**, Maya runs a single **Paid Media Controller** journey:

- AEP & Real-Time CDP hold the data and one master “qualified accounts” audience
- AJO B2B runs an account journey
- **Split-path logic (waterfall)** routes accounts into the right tier:
  - Targeted Pursuits  
  - Solution-Led  
  - Persona  
  - Category Awareness  
  - Foundational Awareness  
- **Activate to Destination** sends each path to the right LinkedIn (or other) campaign

One journey.  
One source of truth.  
No manual list exports.

## Why It Matters for B2B Enterprises

Organizations adopting this pattern can:

- Eliminate manual suppression and exclusion logic
- Scale to **tens of thousands of accounts**
- Manage **millions of person-level profiles**
- Maintain a **single source of truth**
- Automatically adapt as campaign focus and sales goals change
- Dynamically manage spend and delivery across paid media channels

### Success KPIs

- **Awareness:** Are target accounts seeing the right ads and moving appropriately?
- **Engagement:** Does removing overlap improve conversion?
- **Efficiency:** Has manual list work decreased?
- **Cost:** How does cost per acquired account/opportunity change?

# Paid Media Journey Orchestration

A common use case is **B2B paid media journey orchestration**:

Ensuring every qualified account is assigned to exactly one campaign tier and activated to the correct paid media destination—without overlap or manual handoffs.

The controller journey:

1. **Reads** a qualified-account audience (from Real-Time CDP)
2. **Evaluates** accounts through waterfall conditions:
   - Pursuit  
   - Solution-led  
   - Persona  
   - Category intent  
   - Foundational  
3. **Activates** each path to the corresponding destination

When account attributes change, re-entry rules re-evaluate and reassign accounts automatically.
